## Issue Diagnosis

### Primary Issues Identified:

1. **Missing Import Error**: `ReferenceError: Select is not defined` in `ai-assistant.tsx`
   - The Select component is used but not imported
   - This is causing the AI Assistant page to crash completely

2. **Import Statement Issues**: 
   - Missing Select, SelectContent, SelectItem, SelectTrigger, SelectValue imports
   - These are required for the project selection dropdown

3. **Component Accessibility Warnings**:
   - Missing `Description` or `aria-describedby={undefined}` for DialogContent
   - This affects the auth modal and other dialog components

### Root Cause Analysis:

The AI Assistant page imports most UI components correctly but is missing the Select component family imports. This causes a runtime error when the component tries to render the project selection dropdown.

## Fix Implementation Plan

### Step 1: Fix Missing Select Component Imports
- Add missing Select component imports to `ai-assistant.tsx`
- Ensure all Select-related components are properly imported

### Step 2: Fix Product Backlog Import Issues
- Verify all imports in `product-backlog.tsx` are correct
- Check for any missing UI component imports

### Step 3: Fix Accessibility Issues
- Add proper aria-describedby attributes to dialog components
- Ensure all modals have proper accessibility markup

### Step 4: Verify AI Service Integration
- Check that AI service calls are properly handled
- Ensure error boundaries are in place for API failures

## Technical Implementation

### Files to Modify:
1. `client/src/pages/ai-assistant.tsx` - Fix Select imports
2. `client/src/pages/product-backlog.tsx` - Verify imports
3. `client/src/components/auth-modal.tsx` - Fix accessibility warnings

### Expected Outcome:
- AI Assistant page loads without errors
- Product Backlog generation works correctly
- All accessibility warnings resolved
- Proper error handling for AI service calls

## Testing Plan

1. Load AI Assistant page - should render without console errors
2. Select a project from dropdown - should work properly
3. Test AI conversation functionality
4. Test product backlog generation
5. Verify no accessibility warnings in console

## Risk Assessment

- **Low Risk**: Import fixes are straightforward
- **Medium Risk**: Ensure no breaking changes to existing functionality
- **Mitigation**: Test all AI features after implementation

## Success Criteria

- [ ] No console errors on AI Assistant page
- [ ] Project selection dropdown works
- [ ] AI conversation flows properly
- [ ] Product backlog generation functions
- [ ] All accessibility warnings resolved
