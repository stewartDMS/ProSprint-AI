## Updated Issue Diagnosis

After deeper analysis of the current codebase, I've identified the specific causes of the content duplication on the landing page:

### 1. **CSS Animation Conflicts**
The landing page uses multiple animation classes (`animate-slide-up`, `animate-float`) that are causing layout shifts and potential content duplication:
```tsx
<div className="animate-slide-up">
<div className="relative animate-float">
```

### 2. **Complex Single Component Structure**
The current `landing.tsx` is a massive single component (400+ lines) with all sections in one return statement:
- Hero Section
- Features Section  
- Pricing Section
- CTA Section

This monolithic structure makes it prone to rendering issues and is difficult to debug.

### 3. **CSS Layout Issues**
In `index.css`, there are conflicting styles:
```css
main {
  position: relative;
  z-index: 1;
}

.min-h-screen {
  min-height: 100vh;
  max-width: 100vw;
  overflow-x: hidden;
}
```

The `overflow-x: hidden` combined with the animation transforms may be causing content to duplicate.

### 4. **Container Nesting Problems**
The landing page has deeply nested containers:
```tsx
<div className="min-h-screen bg-white overflow-x-hidden">
  <main className="relative">
    <section className="relative overflow-hidden bg-gradient-to-br...">
      <div className="max-w-7xl mx-auto px-6 lg:px-8 py-20 lg:py-32">
```

This excessive nesting with multiple `relative` and `overflow` properties is creating layout conflicts.

### 5. **React Hot Reload Issues**
The webview logs show multiple Vite hot updates for the landing page:
```
["[vite] hot updated: /src/pages/landing.tsx"]
["[vite] hot updated: /src/index.css?v=Kbhk_9Rai9vdsasfG-cWI"]
```

These rapid updates during development may be causing state inconsistencies.

## Root Cause Analysis

The primary issue is **CSS animation transforms combined with complex container nesting** causing the browser to render duplicate content during layout recalculations. The secondary issue is the **monolithic component structure** making it difficult to isolate and fix rendering problems.

## Refined Repair Plan

### Phase 1: Modularize Landing Page Components ‚≠ê PRIORITY
Break down the monolithic landing page into smaller, manageable components:
1. `HeroSection.tsx`
2. `FeaturesSection.tsx` 
3. `PricingSection.tsx`
4. `CTASection.tsx`

### Phase 2: Fix CSS Animation Issues
1. Remove conflicting animation classes from nested elements
2. Simplify container structure
3. Use `transform3d(0,0,0)` to force hardware acceleration
4. Add `will-change` properties for animated elements

### Phase 3: Clean Up Container Structure
1. Reduce excessive nesting
2. Remove redundant `overflow` and `position` properties
3. Simplify the main wrapper structure

### Phase 4: Add CSS Isolation
1. Add specific CSS classes for landing page sections
2. Use CSS containment to prevent layout bleeding
3. Add proper z-index management

### Phase 5: Optimize for React Hot Reload
1. Ensure component boundaries are clean
2. Add proper React keys for list items
3. Minimize inline styles that cause re-renders

## Implementation Steps

### Step 1: Create Modular Components
Extract each section into its own component file in `/client/src/components/`

### Step 2: Fix CSS Animation Conflicts
Update `index.css` to remove conflicting animation properties and add proper containment:
```css
.landing-section {
  contain: layout style paint;
  transform: translateZ(0);
}

.landing-animation {
  will-change: transform, opacity;
  backface-visibility: hidden;
}
```

### Step 3: Simplify Landing Page Structure
Refactor the main landing component to use the modular components with cleaner markup

### Step 4: Test Rendering Isolation
Ensure each section renders independently without affecting others

## Files to Modify
1. `client/src/pages/landing.tsx` - Refactor to use modular components
2. `client/src/components/hero-section.tsx` - Create/update hero component
3. `client/src/components/features-section.tsx` - Create features component
4. `client/src/components/pricing-section.tsx` - Create pricing component  
5. `client/src/components/cta-section.tsx` - Create CTA component
6. `client/src/index.css` - Add containment and fix animation conflicts

## Expected Outcome
- No content duplication on landing page
- Improved performance through component isolation
- Easier maintenance and debugging
- Smooth animations without layout conflicts
- Clean React hot reload behavior

## Risk Assessment
- **Low Risk**: Component modularization is safe and improves maintainability
- **Medium Risk**: CSS changes may affect animations (easily reversible)
- **Low Risk**: Markup simplification reduces complexity

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Animations work smoothly without duplicates
- [ ] Hot reload doesn't cause duplication
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained
- [ ] No console errors or warnings
- [ ] Page performance improved
- [ ] All interactive elements functional
