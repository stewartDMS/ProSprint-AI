
# AI Product Assistant Fix Analysis and Implementation

## Issues Identified

### 1. Frontend TypeScript Errors
- **Problem**: `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'replace')` and `Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'map')`
- **Root Cause**: The AI Assistant component was trying to access properties on undefined objects
- **Fix**: Added proper null checks and default values for arrays and objects

### 2. Backend Route Inconsistencies
- **Problem**: Frontend sending different field names than backend expects
- **Root Cause**: Backend expects `title` field for features, but code was using `name`
- **Fix**: Updated feature creation to use correct field mapping

### 3. Missing AI Conversation Persistence
- **Problem**: AI conversations were not being saved to database
- **Root Cause**: No backend routes or storage methods for conversations
- **Fix**: Added complete CRUD operations for AI conversations

### 4. Navigation Issues
- **Problem**: Generated content not accessible from AI Assistant
- **Root Cause**: No direct links to generated deliverables
- **Fix**: Added navigation links and URL parameter handling

### 5. Missing CRUD Operations
- **Problem**: No edit/delete functionality for AI-generated items
- **Root Cause**: UI components missing edit/delete buttons and mutations
- **Fix**: Added complete CRUD operations with proper UI
